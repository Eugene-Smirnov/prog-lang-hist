          <h3>What is scrum?</h3>
          Scrum is framework methodology (philosophy?) that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through
          adaptive solutions for complex problems.

          <h3>In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.</li>
            <li>The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.</li>
            <li>The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.</li>
            <li>Repeat</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>pillars of scrum</h3>

          <h3>transparency</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The emergent process and work must be <u><b>visible</b></u> to those performing the work as well as those
              receiving the work.
            </li>
            <li>
              With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts. Artifacts
              that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk. Transparency
              enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>inspection</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to
              detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in
              the form of its five events.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are
              designed to provoke change.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Adaptation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable,
              the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as
              soon as possible to minimize further deviation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum
              Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.
            </li>
